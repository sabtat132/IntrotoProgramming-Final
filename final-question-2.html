function countOddNumbers(numbers) {
  var a;  //%is a wildcard - aka divisible by 2 means even
  if(a%2==0)
  {
    alert("This is an even number");
  }
  else{
    alert("This is an odd number");
  }
}

// the following alert should show 3 - 3/5 are odd
alert(countOddNumbers([1,2,3,4,5]));

// the following alert should show 1 - only 1/5 are odd
alert(countOddNumbers([10,12,13,14,16]));


//i will say i keep getting undefined for even - so i have a feeling it may be from using a wildcard
